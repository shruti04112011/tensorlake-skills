## [2.0.1] — SDK 0.4.39 — 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **check_drift.py** — eliminated false positives from cross-module symbol leakage, third-party API params, and multi-line import extraction gaps

  - Expanded `_EXAMPLE_VAR_RE` patterns (`*_client`, `*_numbers`, `*_results`, ALL_CAPS tool defs)
  - Fixed code block regex to handle ```` ```python  theme={null} ```` format from fetched docs
  - Added TIER2 pattern for typed function signatures with lowercase Python types
